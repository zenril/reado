                <h3>Chapter Prologue</h3>
                <h3>Prologue</h3>
                <p>Tree, tree, tree…</p>
                <p>Turning around 360 degrees, there are thick trees growing everywhere I look.</p>
                <p>A lonely forest with no roads, my feet get covered in bushes with every step.</p>
                <p>
                    I can see a faint light through a gap of the branches so it’s a daytime, but because of the crowded
                    trees, the overall mood is gloomy.
                </p>
                <p>Syl…… wasn’t there a little better starting place?</p>
                <p>Why here? There should have been many alternatives, right?</p>
                <p>「Gururururu」</p>
                <p>
                    The person who I separated from a little while ago would probably permit me a complaint or two…
                    While thinking so, I suddenly hear a beast’s growl and look around in panic.
                </p>
                <p>Certainly, a beast is running towards me――A Red Wolf.</p>
                <p>Red Wolf is a red, large-breed dog-like wolf monster. If I’m not mistaken, it’s a Rank C?</p>
                <p>It has completely marked me as its prey.</p>
                <p>
                    I have no confidence because I’m improvising, but if I can’t just stand here and let it attack me,
                    so I point my hand like a pistol at the Red Wolf.
                </p>
                <p>「《Air Shot》」</p>
                <p>At the same time I shout, a lump of air shoots from my finger.</p>
                <p>I fire a compressed air magic which resembles a bullet.</p>
                <p>The air bullet hits the target, the Red Wolf『Gyain』whinnes and gets blown off backwards.</p>
                <p>I feel relieved that I hit the target properly, but I’m still cautious in case it can still move.</p>
                <p>「This is the beginning, huh……」</p>
                <p>Haa… I sigh, approach the Red Wolf’s dead body and store it with《Infinite Storage》.</p>

                <p>Chapter 1</p>
                <h3>Chapter 1 – Who are you?</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>「I am terribly sorry!」</p>
                <p>Who are you?</p>
                <p>An unknown silver-haired youth is suddenly prostrating in front of me on the floor .</p>
                <p>Around 20 years old…… I think he’s younger than me .</p>
                <p>Because he’s facing the floor without flinching, I can’t see his face .</p>
                <p>I don’t understand…… why? I think that he surely has a well-featured face .</p>
                <p>The reason why he’s prostrating in front of me is unknown .</p>
                <p>Because I have woken up in this unknown place just a several minutes ago .</p>
                <p>That’s right .</p>
                <p>Before I noticed, I already was in a room I don’t recognize .</p>
                <p>A room surrounded by white walls from every direction .</p>
                <p>The size is around 8 tatami, I think…… There are two white doors . There are no windows .</p>
                <p>There are two leathered-covered sofas for two people facing each other .</p>
                <hr />
                A jet-black glass table is in between the sofas . Nothing else is here aside from that .
                <p>Uun…… because of the white walls, this room seems like a “typical” president’s office .</p>
                <p>Maa, that does not matter, though .</p>
                <p>Since I don’t recognize this place, is this a kidnapping?</p>
                <p>
                    I thought so at first, but I’m not restricted and above all, I think that the kidnapper is quite a
                    considerable person……
                </p>
                <p>After wandering around the room aimlessly, I return my sight at the youth on the floor .</p>
                <p>Un, he’s still lowering his head .</p>
                <p>Is that it? You won’t do anything unless I say something thing?</p>
                <p>I would already like the explanation .</p>
                <p>Can’t be helped, let’s greet him first .</p>
                <p>「Ah~ Umm, who are you and what do you want from me after bringing me here?」</p>
                <p>When I spoke, the youth finally raised his head .</p>
                <p>Un, as expected, he’s a terrible handsome young man .</p>
                <hr />
                A green eyes together with silver hair . A tall figure with facial features that would put Hollywood
                stars to shame .
                <p>The clothes he is wearing are plain and white, but that makes him look rather attractive .</p>
                <p>I can’t find any faults .</p>
                <p>This goes past envy, it may be worth of respect .</p>
                <p>While I’m on such topic, he was also staring back at me who is impolitely observing him .</p>
                <p>…… He’s still sitting on the floor, though .</p>
                <p>Because he was looking at me like that, I had to tell him 『Wait』 as I would command a dog……</p>
                <p>This, am I the bad guy? Am I getting misunderstood? I’m not a bad person, though!</p>
                <p>He has been apologizing since the beginning, so I shouldn’t be at fault . Probably!</p>
                <p>「…… How do you do? I’m Kayano Takumi」</p>
                <p>「Thank you kindly for the politeness . My name is Sylphreel . Please, call my Syl」</p>
                <p>「…………」</p>
                <p>「…………」</p>
                <p>Haa, he sighs and introduces himself while bowing .</p>
                <p>He doesn’t do anything aside from that .</p>
                <p>He properly answered me . Yosh, I can go ahead like this! Is what I though, but――。</p>
                <p>――The conversation didn’t continue……</p>
                <p>Why did it end with self-introductions?!</p>
                <p>Where’s the follow-up? An explanation, please!</p>
                <p>The one who knows the circumstances is you, Syl!</p>
                <p>「…… Ah~――Syl-san, who are you, where am I and why am I here?」</p>
                <p>
                    「No need for honorifics . ――From Takumi-san’s standpoint, I’m a god . This place is called a Holy
                    sanctuary」
                </p>
                <p>「………… Haa!?」</p>
                <p>This youth is a god and this play is a sanctuary?</p>
                <p>Is this a new scam?</p>
                <p>「This is not a scam」</p>
                <p>「!!」</p>
                <p>Eh? Were my thoughts just read?</p>
                <p>「No . Although I can read minds, I didn’t read that before」</p>
                <p>「Then, how do you know!?」</p>
                <p>「Somehow, I thought you wouldn’t believe so I intended to correct it」</p>
                <p>Nonono! You have been like an abandoned puppy a while ago, why are you suddenly so calm?</p>
                <p>It’s strange no matter how much I think about it!?</p>
                <p>
                    But, I understand! I have understood that I will get only tired talking to this person in a serious
                    manner!
                </p>
                <p>「……… Can you explain simply?」</p>
                <p>「Ah, I’m sorry . I have killed you by mistake」</p>
                <p>Too simple!!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="chr-content" class="chr-c">
                <p>Chapter 2</p>
                <h3>Chapter 2 – The explanation, please</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>『Ah, I’m sorry . I have killed you by mistake』</p>
                <p>Unexpected murder report .</p>
                <p>It seems I have been somehow murdered by this god……</p>
                <p>When we move to the sofa and I hear Syl’s explanation――</p>
                <p>
                    「Umm…… there appeared a “distortion” in a certain place, so I wanted to reinforce it, but I put too
                    much power into it and it passed through . This “distortion” connected with a place where Takumi-san
                    was at that time so… that… the great power passed through and directly hit Takumi-san…」
                </p>
                <p>Haa――――――――………</p>
                <p>I let out a lengthy sigh .</p>
                <p>
                    According to Syl’s explanation, he didn’t have any ill intent, but I died because of a trivial (?)
                    power measurement error .
                </p>
                <p>However, it doesn’t seem like it ends here .</p>
                <p>
                    Under the influence of the power which directly hit my body, I have been already extinguished . He
                    apparently narrowly pulled my soul into this sanctuary, but my soul still received a great shock and
                    because of that it’s not able to enter the circle of reincarnation again .
                </p>
                <p>This seems to be the reason Syl was prostrating before me .</p>
                <p>
                    Uun…… Although I can’t reincarnate again, normally, a person who died won’t notice that he’s
                    reincarnated, right?
                </p>
                <p>A person who remembers his previous life should be rare, right?</p>
                <p>All my 28 years of life would get “deleted, right?</p>
                <p>
                    I don’t know what happens after one dies naturally, but since I am able to hold a conversation like
                    this, should I be delighted that my soul is safe?
                </p>
                <p>「So, what is going happen to me from now on?」</p>
                <p>「Eeeeh!?」</p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    I judged that rather than worrying about death, what is going to happen to me from now on is more
                    important so when I asked Syl made a strange face .
                </p>
                <p>「Eh? Is there perhaps no after-sales service?」</p>
                <p>Seriously!? Am I going to remain like this?</p>
                <p>Will I remain a soul-like existence floating around?</p>
                <p>Eh? Ghost? An unnatural existence?</p>
                <p>
                    「No, wrong! I have prepared for words of abuse, so Takumi-san’s words just greatly surprised me」
                </p>
                <p>「Ah~ Un . I have a feeling that words of abuse would be more suitable for Syl」</p>
                <p>「…………」</p>
                <p>
                    Although I should be angry, I don’t have the recollection of actually dying . Therefore, somehow, I
                    don’t have any will to get angry .
                </p>
                <p>Besides, Syl has been keeping a low profile since the beginning so I have no motivation?</p>
                <p>
                    If that was his intention that would make me, on the contrary, angry, but I have figured in this
                    short time that Syl doesn’t know how to properly express himself .
                </p>
                <p>「It’s a lie . I half joked」</p>
                <p>「Ha, half!?」</p>
                <p>「Un . Half . It’s true that you made a mistake in the measurement of power, reflect on it」</p>
                <p>「…… Yes」</p>
                <p>Un, I have figured out how to handle Syl .</p>
                <p>
                    Is it okay to handle a god with such attitude? Is what I thought, but since Syl doesn’t seem to
                    mind, it’s alright I guess?
                </p>
                <p>「I will leave depression for later . So, what is going happen to me?」</p>
                <hr />
                「Ah, yes . First, I will make Takumi-san a new body, then I will put your soul into it」
                <p>「A new body?」</p>
                <p>「Yes . I will compose it for you with my power」</p>
                <p>Syl is going to make it……</p>
                <p>……………</p>
                <p>…………</p>
                <p>………</p>
                <p>……</p>
                <p>「……………… I’m worried you will fail and create something strange, though」</p>
                <p>I’m somewhat uneasy…… Syl, he looks like the clumsy type…</p>
                <p>
                    Physical limbs are missing! Is not what will probably happen, but… I’m worried about the things with
                    normal functions……
                </p>
                <p>「I won’t! It’s all right!! I will use all my power to create a proper one!!」</p>
                <p>「I have a feeling that all your power is dangerous so stop it . Create it carefully…… and then」</p>
                <p>
                    「Yes, I will do my best! Unfortunately, because Takumi-san’s new body will have my power dwelling
                    inside, it won’t be able to return back to Earth . Therefore, I will move you to a different world I
                    manage――Aetherdia . Right, it would be called a different world for Takumi-san」
                </p>
                <p>Aetherdia is the world with five gods .</p>
                <p>God of Creation, Malianor</p>
                <p>Fire God, Salamanteel</p>
                <p>Water God, Windell</p>
                <hr />
                Wind God, Sylphreel
                <p>Earth God, Nomoodle</p>
                <p>The God of Creation, Malianor-sama is the chief god . Syl and the others support Malianor-sama .</p>
                <p>And it’s apparently the well-known world of sword and magic .</p>
                <p>「Fu~n . I have no physical ability, won’t I easily die, though?」</p>
                <p>「It’s all right! I will make you a healthy body, after all! Also, I will give you skills!!」</p>
                <p>「Skills, huh…」</p>
                <p>「That’s right! Skills!! Do you have something, in particular, you would like?」</p>
                <p>「Let’s see…… First, not knowing the language would be inconvential」</p>
                <p>Language is important . Not having a mutual understanding spells trouble .</p>
                <p>
                    「Language and common knowledge are easy to insert to the body, don’t worry about it . Also, I will
                    attach an appraisal skill」
                </p>
                <p>「That’s good, I will leave it to you . Also, an item box! Do you have something like that?」</p>
                <p>When it comes to a different world, it’s an item box, right?</p>
                <p>The difficulty will change depending on its existence .</p>
                <p>
                    「There are high capacity magic tools called Magic Bag, but I recommend a variety of space
                    magic《Infinite Storage》which also stops the passage of time」
                </p>
                <p>「Oh~ that’s it! I would also want some self-defense magic or technique」</p>
                <p>
                    「I understand . If you don’t have any specifications, I will choose for you, is that all right?」
                </p>
                <p>Infinite Storage! Sounds nice . Stopping passage of time sounds attractive .</p>
                <p>Something to protect the body with is left!</p>
                <p>Magic has lots of possibilities, huh… And it’s not like I will be able to use a weapon……</p>
                <p>
                    I don’t understand the varieties of magic, will it be okay to leave it to Syl? He’s more or less a
                    god, he will probably choose something suitable, right?
                </p>
                <p>「I will leave it to you . Also, please don’t throw me out penniless」</p>
                <p>
                    「I understand . It has been decided to use my attribute, wind magic for now then . I will insert
                    the knowledge on using magic inside the body, okay! Also, I will put a necessary amount of money
                    inside the 《Infinite Storage》!」
                </p>
                <p>
                    Syl is the Wind God, after all . Speaking of wind magic, Wind Cutter, and Air Bullet are basic,
                    right? Maa~ If he inserts the knowledge inside the body, will I be able to use magic reflexively?
                    That will be helpful if that’s the case .
                </p>
                <p>Oh, moreover, not just money . What about an item! I want to ask .</p>
                <p>
                    「Are you ready? Takumi-san will have to sleep while I insert the soul inside the body, do you have
                    something you want to ask before it’s too late?」
                </p>
                <p>「Un? Is this the last time we can talk?」</p>
                <p>
                    「Talking directly won’t be possible for a while . If you pray towards my statue in a shrine, we
                    should be able to converse」
                </p>
                <p>「Is it all right to contact a god?」</p>
                <p>
                    「Yes . There won’t be any problem . There might be a time when I’m busy and unable to answer, but
                    it should be okay to contact me anytime」
                </p>
                <p>Language is okay . Knowledge is good . Essential skills and items are prepared .</p>
                <p>Is it all right?</p>
                <p>「I can’t think of anything right now, I will rely on the shrine if I have something」</p>
                <p>
                    「Yes . I will be waiting for you . I have caused you trouble . The next time you wake up, you will
                    be in that world . Please, enjoy you new life without a fail」
                </p>
                <p>I nod to Syl and my consciousness fades away .</p>
                <p>Ah, I forgot to tell Syl to emphasize the work on my appearances .</p>

                <p>Blessed by the God of Creation, Malianor</p>
                <p>=====</p>
                <p>A status screen appeared .</p>
                <p>
                    Alright, the name is my full name . Those with Family name are nobility! Though there are cases like
                    that, it should to be all right .
                </p>
                <hr />
                Eeeh!? Race! Question mark!? I, I am not a human?
                <p>
                    Rather, a follower? I have become god’s family (Temporary)!? I didn’t hear anything about this,
                    Syl!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why!? Is what I thought, but thinking about it carefully, this body was made by Syl so it’s probably
                    because of that……? He said something about his power dwelling inside…… it can’t be helped at this
                    time…… let’s leave it at that .
                </p>
                <p>Class . Blank space . Maa, that’s right .</p>
                <p>20 years old… I became younger……</p>
                <p>Level 3 . Un? …… Ah, did my level raise after killing the Red Wolf? Then, no problems here .</p>
                <p>
                    Skills are…… relatively decent…? To be honest, I thought Syl might forget because he’s like that .
                    Un, I’m somehow relieved .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s see…… the numbers are proficiency? 50 is generally “more or less usable”, over 100 is skilled
                    . Over 200 is master rank . 300 is MAX? Getting that far is a miracle .
                </p>
                <p>
                    I see~ Looking at the proficiency numbers of the skills, the magic and such is what Syl gave me and
                    cooking and such are what I already had originally?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because I lived alone, cooking was mundane, I sewed my buttons and did some weekend carpentering .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, the resistances…… are completely strange? The proficiency is MAXED . Is this that? That thing
                    Syl said he will choose himself? Ah, mou…… he was too enthusiastic…
                </p>
                <p>Umm, next is titles . Titles are something like nicknames or aliases?</p>
                <p>Transmigrated From a Different World…… Maa~ seems right .</p>
                <p>The God of Creation Malianor is the chief god who is supported by the four others, right?</p>
                <p>What is a blessing? When did I receive a blessing? Maa… while I was asleep, right…</p>
                <p>But, wouldn’t it say “Blessing of the Wind God’s Sylphreel” normally?</p>
                <p>――Piron♪</p>
                <p>Ah, the titles increased .</p>
                <p>Let’s see, let’s see……【Friend of Wind God Sylphreel】…………</p>
                <p>Yosh! Let’s move on!</p>
                <p>U~mm, next is……</p>
                <p>There’s a tab beside status and item menu .</p>
                <p>It’s a map .</p>
                <p>When I try to view that, a map appears on the whole screen . This is apparently a world map .</p>
                <p>
                    Rough dotted lines are drawn, country names and their capitals are displayed . There are ten
                    countries on the main continent . One island country . And one federal state on a small archipelago
                    . There are 12 countries in total .
                </p>
                <p>There’s a forest on the south side of a central country on the continent .</p>
                <p>There’s small white pin stuck in the place it says『Gaya Forest』 .</p>
                <p>When I touch that pin, the map zooms in and the area around the pin becomes detailed .</p>
                <p>Un, this is the place I’m at . I’m sure .</p>
                <p>When I move while looking at the map, the pin also moves . Present location found!</p>
                <p>I slide the map away and inquire about the details of this forest .</p>
                <p>This『Gaya Forest』is large . Furthermore, this forest passed through five countries .</p>
                <p>
                    Where should I go? From my present location, the Tia Country in the east is closest . There’s a town
                    called Shirin slightly away from the forest .
                </p>
                <p>Let’s go there . The destination, a town called Shirin .</p>
                <p>Umm, next is……</p>
                <p>
                    The next tab is item list . While thinking to examine that, I felt like someone was watching me, so
                    I turned around and saw two little children looking at me .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lapis lazuli colored hair and gold eyes . Thin bodies with simple ragged clothes stained with dirt .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Judging from the atmosphere, one is a girl and one a boy, but two of them looks exactly the same .
                </p>
                <p>Twins?</p>
                <p>It’s strange that there are children alone in the forest, I don’t sense any other people around .</p>
                <p>「Are you lost? Did you come here alone?」</p>
                <p>
                    When I ask the most plausible reason, the children tilt their heads . They look blankly at me in
                    silence .
                </p>
                <p>When I take a step forward, they take a step back .</p>
                <p>…… They seem to be cautious of me .</p>
                <p>I use the appraisal skill and a window appears in front of me .</p>
                <p>Seems like appraising people is possible .</p>
                <p>=====</p>

                ????
                <p>=====</p>
                <p>It seems I’m not able to view skill proficiency of other people .</p>
                <p>Or is it related to proficiency of my appraisal skill?</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, why do I feel like the status of these two children is not normal…</p>
                <p>The name parts are blank… it means that they don’t have names, right?</p>
                <p>Also, “human?” again . Is that race normal over here?</p>
                <p>The titles part is question marks…</p>
                <p>N~ what should I do? First of all, leaving like this would be inhumane…</p>
                <p>「There’s nothing to fear, won’t you come over here?」</p>
                <p>Ah, they came when I called .</p>
                <p>I had to drop on my knees and timidly beckon them, but they approached .</p>
                <p>「Umm, 《Washing》… and《Heal》」</p>
                <p>
                    First, I cleaned their bodies with Life Magic . As the name suggest, Life Magic is closely related
                    to livelihood . Wash the target with《Washing》, illuminate surroundings with《Light》, make things
                    dry with《Dry》etc…… It has the smallest power, but it has a wide range of uses, it’s a convenient
                    magic usable with the smallest amount of magic power .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The eyes of the two shined and blinked in surprise, but they probably judged that they are in no
                    danger so they didn’t run away .
                </p>
                <p>
                    After making their bodies clean, I could see small wounds all over their bodies so I healed them
                    with healing magic . Healing Magic is Light attribute magic so I have it .
                </p>
                <p>「Yosh! This is good . The next is a meal……」</p>
                <p>They are this thin, they must be very hungry .</p>
                <p>I check the item list while thinking so .</p>
                <p>
                    「Umm, there is…… money, equipment, medicine… water and food . Food is… umm…… hard-baked bread and
                    dried meat… It seems too hard for the children right now . It seems hard to digest… Ah, fruit .
                    Would this be easier to eat?」
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fruit, Ranka is sweet and rehydrating, it greatly resembles a peach . I retrieve fruits from
                    the《Infinite Storage》and offer it to the two children .
                </p>
                <p>「Here, eat this」</p>
                <p>I place the fruit in the hands of the two children .</p>
                <p>
                    The two examine and sniff the Ranka fruit in their hands . After a while, they confirm that it’s not
                    dangerous and start eating .
                </p>
                <p>They look like small animals .</p>
                <hr />
                Seeing them comfortably eating, I once again confirm the contents of the item list .
                <p>「There’s also… raw meat, vegetables, and wheat flour…… huh……」</p>
                <p>…… Syl . Even if you give me ingredients, I can’t cook without seasonings……</p>
                <p>――Piron♪</p>
                <p>Ah, an item was added .</p>
                <p>
                    A set of kitchen utensils and seasonings were added to the item list after I complained towards Syl
                    . Seems like Syl confirmed the circumstances over here and send me the items .
                </p>
                <p>There’s only one thing I can do!</p>
                <p>I would love tableware . Additional change of clothes and towels would be nice .</p>
                <p>
                    Ah, there a considerable distance from here to the nearest town . An overcoat or blanket would
                    really help for camping .
                </p>
                <p>――Piron♪</p>
                <p>I heard a mechanical sound from somewhere and a large quantity of items was added to the list .</p>
                <p>…… Un . Syl, thank you .</p>
                <p>While I was doing that, the children finished eating the fruit and jii~ were staring at me .</p>
                <p>
                    Because the clothes added to the item list were not only for me, but even for the children, I
                    decided to change their clothes .
                </p>
                <p>I click on the《Clothes》on the item list and retrieve clothes from the《Infinite Storage》 .</p>
                <p>「Isn’t it too tight, can you move freely?」</p>
                <p>Oh, they nodded . It seems all right .</p>
                <p>These children, although they do not talk, they properly understand me, right?</p>
                <p>
                    「I’m now going to leave the forest and go to the nearby town, do you want to go together with me?」
                </p>
                <p>I can’t leave the children here so I ask them, the two children look at each other .</p>
                <p>They seem to be conversing . Although they are not talking…</p>
                <p>Is that it? The mutual understanding between twins?</p>
                <p>They look at me . Did they decide? Nodding means they want to go with me, right?</p>
                <p>「I’m Takumi . Best regards」</p>

                <hr />
                Therefore――
                <p>「Yosh, I decided! You are Allen . And you are Elena」</p>
                <p>
                    I think it would be inconvenient from now on if they didn’t have names, I named the boy Allen, and
                    the girl Elena .
                </p>
                <p>I somehow felt these names would be suitable .</p>
                <p>Were the names appropriate? Allen and Elene seem satisfied so it’s okay .</p>
                <p>When I checked their statuses, it had already recognized them as Allen and Elena .</p>
                <p>
                    I don’t know what criteria it has been decided on, but changing it again is now impossible .
                    Hahaha~!
                </p>
                <p>In such way, the three of us peacefully walk through the forest .</p>
                <p>The two children are thin, but they have stamina . They are following me without complaining .</p>
                <p>
                    However, because they are without a doubt children, I take a break and let them drink water and eat
                    dried persimmons .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dried persimmons? It something Syl has added into my inventory . There are several types of dried
                    fruit, there was also some onigiri, but they are already eaten .
                </p>
                <hr />
                By the way, rice does exist in Aetherdia . It’s called white wheat over here and is mainly used as feed
                for domestic animals .
                <p>If I want to buy some, I will have no chance buy to purchase it from a domestic animal farmhouse?</p>
                <p>Ah! It seems something similar to soy sauce and miso also exists!</p>
                <p>
                    After all, for a Japanese, it’s a rice! Soy Sauce! Miso! Right~ I’m glad this world also have them~♪
                </p>
                <p>
                    Has it been approximately after an hour that we started walking again? Allen and Elena started
                    suddenly running .
                </p>
                <p>「Eh? What!?」</p>
                <p>
                    What came into my sight was two children chasing after a huge boar three times the size of them――I
                    saw them charging at a Giant Boar .
                </p>
                <p>「Allen! Elena!」</p>
                <p>
                    They run with all their power, but they doesn’t seem to be able to catch up . They are obviously
                    chasing after a monster .
                </p>
                <hr />
                I can’t shoot the monster with magic because the two are there .
                <p>What should I do!? While thinking so――</p>
                <p>
                    Allen and Elena vigorously run towards one of the Giant Boars without stopping and give it a flying
                    kick .
                </p>
                <p>The Giant Boar they kicked screams『Buhi』and gets blown off backward .</p>
                <p>Once they kick it, they jump up right after landing and give an axe kick to the Wild Boars neck .</p>
                <p>The Giant Boar goes doshin and collapses .</p>
                <p>「………」</p>
                <p>So strong! What are these five-year-olds!!</p>
                <p>
                    These children certainly are level 12, but… Eh, is this normal!? A common sense of children of this
                    world?
                </p>
                <p>That can’t be true . Normal children would die .</p>
                <p>
                    While I unconsciously stopped running because of the shock and stood in place absentmindedly, Allen
                    and Elena returned to my place as if nothing happened .
                </p>
                <p>「「………」」</p>
                <p>「…… Haa――― You two… you knew there was a Giant Boar so you started running?」</p>
                <p>Two two children nod at my deep sigh .</p>
                <p>They seem to understand .</p>
                <p>「Would you tell me next time you found something before you start running?」</p>
                <p>The two children nod again .</p>
                <p>
                    Don’t they have any sense of danger…? It’s a great achievement that these two young children
                    survived like this until now, but if they keep on running away each time a monster appears, I will
                    be in a bind .
                </p>
                <p>I’m taking care of the children, letting them protect me would be foolish .</p>
                <p>
                    After confirming the two aren’t injured I lightly pat their heads, then I face the defeated Giant
                    Boar .
                </p>
                <p>
                    They probably don’t know that monster meat can be eaten . Allen and Elena are ignoring the downed
                    monster .
                </p>
                <p>
                    They don’t have a knife to dismantle it, nor they are able to build fire to cook it, so it may not
                    have any significance for these two .
                </p>
                <p>
                    I collect the Giant Boar while the two look at me with “What are you going to do with that?”
                    expressions .
                </p>
                <hr />
                First of all, let’s store it inside my《Infinite Sotrage》 . If I can sell this in the town, I will
                purchase supplies for these two .
                <p>After deciding, I beckon the two children and walk towards outside of the forest .</p>
                <p>After that .</p>
                <p>Following Giant Boar the three of us encountered the Bloody Bear, Red Wolf x2, Great Monkey x2 .</p>
                <p>
                    Each time, when Allen and Elena noticed a monster, they would pull on my clothes or arms to let me
                    know .
                </p>
                <p>
                    However! Right after letting me know, they would immediately run off and start chasing monsters
                    bigger than me .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not knowing what to do with them, I checked for injuries then patted their heads . The two children
                    close their eyes and smile in comfort while I pat them .
                </p>
                <p>Are? Doesn’t this mean I’m praising them?</p>
                <p>That’s why the two run off chasing after monsters…?</p>
                <p>
                    I thought that my real intentions didn’t transmit, but I couldn’t stop myself from patting Allen’s
                    and Elena’s heads .

                <h3>CHAPTER 5 – THE FIRST CAMPING</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>The overall dark forest became even darker .</p>
                <p>Seems like the sun went down .</p>
                <p>That being the case, I decided to stop advancing for today .</p>
                <p>「Allen, Elena . I will make a fire so help me gather some wood」</p>
                <p>Saying that, I pick up a fallen twig, Allen and Elena imitate me and start gathering .</p>
                <p>What should I do for dinner?</p>
                <p>Syl has supplied me with some ordinary bread, so… let’s make a simple vegetable soup .</p>
                <p>Should I also dismantle the monster meat and make some meat skewers?</p>
                <p>
                    The two children are bright so if I let them eat the dismantled meat, they will realize that monster
                    meat can be consumed .
                </p>
                <p>I store the gathered twigs in the《Infinite Storage》and take out one Red Wolf .</p>
                <p>This is the fellow I killed with the air bullet . Maa, I have no other way at the moment……</p>
                <p>
                    I retrieve a knife, I cut open the Red Wolf’s abdomen first to drain the blood in order to start
                    processing .
                </p>
                <hr />
                If I defeated the Red Wolf with a sword, I would pay attention to the value of the fur and start
                processing from the wounds, but there is no conspicuous wound by killing it with an air bullet, so
                starting at its abdomen is the theory .
                <p>
                    I have the knowledge of dismantling, I even have the skill . Because of that, the dismantling
                    process is mysteriously imprinted in my body .
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s no challenge even though I’m dismantling for the first time . My body moves without
                    hesitation . Even the blood flowing from its cut open abdomen is taken for granted .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new body itself doesn’t feel uncomfortable, but I have realized that the previous Kayano Takumi
                    and the present Kayano Takumi are different .
                </p>
                <p>The dismantling advanced without a delay .</p>
                <p>Allen and Elena ji~ were staring at my first dismantling .</p>
                <p>
                    It’s a gain if they remember the process even if only a little . Still, they are only 5 years old so
                    I really don’t expect them to start dismantling anytime soon .
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I finish, I store the fur, materials, and meat into the《Infinite Storage》and bury the
                    non-usable internal organs in a hole I dug beforehand . The air is filled with the scent of blood so
                    I disperse it with Wind Magic, I washed my body with《Washing》and decided to move a bit just in
                    case .
                </p>
                <p>Now then, with the preparations complete, let’s start making the dinner .</p>
                <p>First, I make a simple stove with the stones and light the fire .</p>
                <p>
                    I have a Life Magic《Ignition》which allows me to make a fire, but I used something called Ignition
                    Stone in order to show Allen and Elena how to make a fire with tools .
                </p>
                <p>Maa, it’s that . It’s similar to a match .</p>
                <p>＝＝＝＝＝</p>
                <p>【Ignition Stone】</p>
                <p>A stone that bursts into a fire when directly injected with magic power .</p>
                <p>Because only fragments of the stone are used, it’s mostly disposable .</p>
                <p>
                    Because they won’t be activated unless directly injected with magic power, storing them away
                    in《Infinite Storage》is possible .
                </p>
                <p>＝＝＝＝＝</p>
                <p>
                    Once the fire is lit, I pour water into a small pot and put it on the stove . Before the water
                    starts boiling, I cut the Red Wolf meat into easy to eat pieces, pierce it on skewers and lightly
                    salt it . I stab it around the stove and let it grill .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the water in the pot is boiling, I add vegetables and adjust the taste with a stock cube and
                    salt .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stock soup is a Japan-like product . It’s a chicken consomme cube of a certain manufacturer1 .
                    There was no packing so I can’t tell certainly, though .
                </p>
                <p>The meat also looks ready when the soup is completed .</p>
                <p>
                    When I handed the grilled Red Wolf meat to Allen and Elena, they both sunk their teeth in without
                    any hesitation . However, the the grilled meat was piping hot so they separated their mouths from it
                    in panic .
                </p>
                <p>I take my share of meat skewers and fuufuu show them how to cool it down .</p>
                <p>Oh! Red Wolf meat is surprisingly tasty .</p>
                <hr />
                Seeing my way of eating, the two children fuufuu imitate me and blow on their skewers and eat .
                <p>
                    This seems to be their first time eating with tableware, so I carefully teach them how to hold a
                    spoon . The children start eating the soup while tightly grasping their spoons .
                </p>
                <p>We have met just a half a day ago, but the two twins are surprisingly attached to me .</p>
                <p>
                    They started eating straight away without cautiously sniffing it like before . They are now eating
                    without hesitation .
                </p>
                <p>「Is it tasty?」</p>
                <p>The two nod at my question .</p>
                <p>Un, they are all smiles .</p>
                <p>
                    Since there is nothing to do after the meal, I intend to sleep even though it just became dark . It
                    would be better to get up earlier in the morning .
                </p>
                <p>Thinking so, I retrieve a Barrier Stones .</p>
                <p>＝＝＝＝＝</p>
                <p>【Barrier Stone】</p>
                <p>A magic tool that can raise a barrier .</p>
                <hr />
                The barrier is set up by stabbing the stake-like stones in the ground in four cardinal directions
                formation . It prevents monsters from entering the space between the stones .
                <p>
                    At least four stones are necessary, the bigger the space between the stones is, the thinner the
                    barrier gets .
                </p>
                <p>＝＝＝＝＝</p>
                <p>Un, it’s a convenient tool .</p>
                <p>
                    I set up the stones 3~4m in all directions . With this, I can sleep in peace without having to worry
                    about being attacked by monsters .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lying on the ground would be indeed painful so I wrap myself in a blanket and sit against a tree .
                </p>
                <p>Is this the most comfortable? What about the children?</p>
                <p>
                    After sitting down, I look at Allen and Elena, but they are standing still, not knowing what to do .
                </p>
                <p>「Allen, Elena . Come」</p>
                <p>The two immediately came to me after calling them .</p>
                <p>Then, I sit them to my sides, extend my hands around them and wrap them with my blanket .</p>
                <p>The two got surprised and couldn’t settle down, but they soon clung to me .</p>
                <p>
                    The children’s bodies are warm like a hot-water bottle, warm and comfortable . It’s not surprising,
                    but I got exhausted by the new environment . The sleepiness attacks me immediately and I fall asleep
                    at once .

                <h3>CHAPTER 6 – THE FIRST TOWN – PART 1</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>We were able to safely pass through the Gaya Forest!</p>
                <p>
                    We have encountered many monsters, but I honestly pleaded to Allen and Elena to let me defeat them,
                    and I brought them down with magic .
                </p>
                <p>I’m glad the children are so understanding! Thanks to that, my level has raised to 11!</p>
                <p>
                    Even so, the forest is bigger than I thought . It took three full days to get out of the forest .
                    Although I’m saying that, our pace was slow and we picked up fruits and herbs on the way .
                </p>
                <p>
                    We got out of the forest’s eastern side on the fourth day . I don’t know how long it would take to
                    get out of the depths of the forest, but it was quite the distance to get out from the edge of the
                    forest . It takes probably more than a month .
                </p>
                <p>Ah! By the way, unlike Earth where the week has 7 days, Aetherdia’s week is 6 days long .</p>
                <p>In order――</p>
                <p>
                    Day of the Light, Day of the Fire, Day of the Water, Day of the Wind, Day of the Earth, Day of the
                    Darkness
                </p>
                <p>――They are called like that .</p>
                <p>24 hours makes a day, 6 days makes a week, and 5 weeks makes a month .</p>
                <p>30 days is a month and 12 months is a year . Therefore, one year consists 360 days .</p>
                <p>The months are called without a change, First Month, Second Month, Third Month……</p>
                <p>First~Third months are Spring</p>
                <p>Fourth~Sixth months are Summer</p>
                <p>Seventh~Ninth months are Fall</p>
                <p>Tenth~Twelfth months are Winter</p>
                <p>
                    They are not much different from Japan’s seasons . East of the continent is warmer, west is colder .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The eastern territories are the hottest in Summer, west territories are the coldest in the Winter .
                </p>
                <p>By the way, it is the Third Month now . Gadia’s weather is very nice .</p>
                <p>
                    An empty grassland spreads before us after leaving the forest . There was something that could be
                    considered a road so we walked for around 4 hours along it before seeing a town .
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we arrive at the gates of the town Shirin, soldiers… no, they are knights . Three knights are
                    on the watch .
                </p>
                <p>The town of Shirin is endorsed as a Rank A impregnable town at the edge of『Gaya Forest』 .</p>
                <hr />
                N? That’s right . We are in a very dangerous place .
                <p>
                    The superior monsters are near the heart of the forest, so the monsters we have encountered were all
                    relatively weak .
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, it’s not known when a strong monster will come out of the forest . There’s a branch of the
                    Knights precisely because the town of Shirin is in such a place .
                </p>
                <p>These knights are guarding the west gate we came to . One of the knight is waiting for us .</p>
                <p>「You! Did you come from the Gaya Forest?」</p>
                <p>「Yes . That’s right」</p>
                <p>The knight makes a surprised expression at my obedient answer .</p>
                <p>
                    Maa~ it’s a dangerous place . I myself don’t look any strong and even if I was, it’s not a place one
                    would normally take children with him .
                </p>
                <p>
                    「There were medicinal herbs I needed . We didn’t go too deep and these children are strong enough
                    to defend themselves」
                </p>
                <p>
                    As expected, I can’t say that I was transferred to the forest by a god and it’s better to answer
                    honestly instead of making poor excuses .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually, we didn’t go to the heart of the forest and we gathered herbs . It’s also the truth that
                    the children are strong .
                </p>
                <p>「Did you get the herbs you needed?」</p>
                <p>「Yes . Fortunately, I was able to obtain them in a nearby place」</p>
                <p>「I see . Don’t be too reckless . Then, you are entering the town, right?」</p>
                <p>
                    「Thank you very much for the advice . Of course, I would like to enter the town, but this is a gate
                    one can enter and exit freely, right?」
                </p>
                <p>The gates are normally open during the daytime, but this gate is closed for some reason .</p>
                <p>But, I check just in case .</p>
                <p>「This is a gate that only a few people come in and out, after all」</p>
                <p>Ah, I see . It’s such a thing .</p>
                <p>The knight answers after looking at the gate and realizing that we are locked out .</p>
                <p>
                    This place is directly facing the Gaya Forest so only authorized knights and high ranked adventurers
                    are utilizing it . Ordinary people rarely approach the gate so there’s no reason to keep the gate
                    open when there’s no traffic .
                </p>
                <p>「Hand me the identification papers」</p>
                <p>「I’m sorry . We come from a rural village so we don’t have identification papers yet」</p>
                <p>「Come this way if that’s the case . We have to do the inspection and other procedures」</p>
                <p>「Yes . Sorry for the inconvenience, but I will be troubling you」</p>
                <p>「Don’t worry about it, that’s our job!」</p>
                <p></p>
                <h3>CHAPTER 6 – THE FIRST TOWN – PART 2</h3>
                <p>「First, please put your hand on this crystal」</p>
                <p>We were taken to a small office-like room and a crystal was presented in front of me .</p>
                <p>I put my hand on it as I was told to . When I do so, the crystal emits a faint white light .</p>
                <p>
                    This is a tool that determines whether one is a criminal or not when touched . It will start shining
                    red if one is a criminal .
                </p>
                <p>
                    When one commits a crime, he will receive a corresponding title, the crystal seems to be reacting to
                    that .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, when people want to start living in the town or when a baby is born, a resident card would be
                    issued and a magic power will be registered at the same time . When the crystal finds out a person
                    who committed a crime, the data would spread through the other crystals distributed worldwide,
                    making it easy for other locations to understand that a criminal is trying to enter the town .
                    Meaning, it’s waste of time trying to flee the country .
                </p>
                <p>「Un . There are no problems . Please, let me inspect the children next」</p>
                <p>
                    Allen and Elena took turns putting their hands at the crystal . There were no problems so I had to
                    pay the 200G (Minors are half the price) toll next .
                </p>
                <p>
                    I pretended that I’m taking money from the pocket while I retrieved 400G from the《Infinite
                    Storage》 .
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is from the knowledge that was inserted into my body, but it seems that there are not many
                    people who have a Space Magic . Therefore, I decided to not use it in public .
                </p>
                <p>The plan is to buy a small bag and use it as if it was a Magic Bag .</p>
                <p>Right, right, the money on Aetherdia is called G(old)――</p>
                <p>Copper Coin = 1G</p>
                <p>Large Copper Coin = 10G</p>
                <hr />
                Silver Coin = 100G
                <p>Large Silver Coin = 1,000G</p>
                <p>Gold Coin = 10,000G</p>
                <p>Large Gold Coin = 100,000G</p>
                <p>Platinum Coin = 1,000,000G</p>
                <p>――The money is using such decimal system .</p>
                <p>One Copper Coin has a value of around 10 yen . Therefore, the toll costs around 2,000 yen .</p>
                <p>
                    By the way, the amount of money I have presently at hand is approximately 1,000,000G . That makes
                    about 10,000,000 yen .
                </p>
                <p>Syl, so generous!</p>
                <p>
                    Also, what is strange that the money is listed as “G” in the item list, but I’m able to retrieve any
                    coin .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is exchanging Copper for Silver hard? . Is what I thought at first . But, I can take out the whole
                    amount in copper coins and I can take it out even in gold coins . How convenient…
                </p>
                <p>
                    「This will be your temporary identification papers . It’s necessary during your stay in town so
                    don’t lose it . Also, if you plan to stay in the town for long, official identification papers would
                    be needed to make」
                </p>
                <p>「Yes . The plan is to register at the Adventurer guild」</p>
                <p>
                    「I see . Then, as soon as your registration is completed, return the temporary identification
                    papers here」
                </p>
                <p>「I understand」</p>
                <p>I ask the kind Knight-samas about a recommended inn and enter the town .</p>
                <p>We advance on the street to the inn the knights recommended to me .</p>
                <p>
                    The number of the people walking down the street is quite high, is it because the town is near the
                    borders?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It seems that Allen and Elena see this many people for the first time as they are clinging around my
                    waist as if glued to it .
                </p>
                <p>This timid action is very cute, but it’s hard to walk .</p>
                <p>This is it,『Komadori Pavilion』 . The recommended inn .</p>
                <hr />
                It’s is an excellent establishment with good security and affordable prices, that’s what the knights
                told me .
                <p>When I open the door, Obasan in her 40 greets us .</p>
                <p>「I’d like to stay, do you have a vacant room?」</p>
                <p>
                    「We have a room . One night for one is 400G, 500G with dinner and breakfast . Hot bath requires a
                    separate fee . 」
                </p>
                <p>When I ask, Obasan politely replies .</p>
                <p>
                    「These children are with me, is it all right? They are obedient children, I don’t think they will
                    be an annoyance」
                </p>
                <p>
                    Small children may cry in the middle of a night, which may cause trouble later so I’m asking
                    beforehand .
                </p>
                <p>「Yes . It’s all right . They are small so they will be fine sleeping in one bed」</p>
                <p>It seems okay . The knight-samas might have recommended this inn with that in mind .</p>
                <p>Moreover, it seems there’s discount for children .</p>
                <p>「Allen, Elena . Are you okay sleeping in one bed?」</p>
                <p>When I ask the two who are clinging to me, they start clinging to me even more for some reason .</p>
                <p>Uun? Does this mean no?</p>
                <p>
                    「Arara . It seems both of them really love Oniisan~ In that case, we have a room with a large bed,
                    would you like to take that room?」
                </p>
                <p>So not a twin, but a double room?</p>
                <p>From the looks of it, it’s unlikely that they will sleep in a separate bed .</p>
                <p>「Let’s do that . That room with the meal, please」</p>
                <p>
                    Because it’s needed to pay in advance, I have paid for a week for now . It’s a recommended inn by
                    the knight-samas, it’s surely all right .
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then, since there’s still time until the dinner, I have asked for a location of a certain place
                    and left the inn .

                <h3>CHAPTER 7 – SHRINE</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>The destination is a Shrine . It’s roughly in the center of the town .</p>
                <p>
                    It’s a white, stone building . Although old, the white color is preserved and the ivy crawling over
                    the walls leaves a deep impression .
                </p>
                <p>
                    A big belfry is attached to the roof, just right now, dong, dong…… six chimes reverberate around the
                    whole town .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bell resounds every day at fixed times . It works as a clock for those who don’t possess a high
                    price magic tool . It basically substitutes a watch .
                </p>
                <p>
                    It chimes once at 6 in the morning . Then, the chime increases once every two hours, the Shrine’s
                    bell chimes until 10 in the evening where it chimes nine times .
                </p>
                <p>Get up with a chime and sleep with nine . The people live around this bell .</p>
                <p>Anyone can freely enter and exit the Shrine chapel .</p>
                <p>
                    The inside is spacious enough to accommodate a good number of people, a passage spreads straight to
                    the altar in the back of the chapel from the entrance .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oblong stools that can fit several adults each are lined along both sides of the passage, facing the
                    altar .
                </p>
                <p>A light shines from the high ceiling, illuminating the chapel .</p>
                <p>Serenity . 5 stone statues are in the interior of the altar wrapped in such atmosphere .</p>
                <p>
                    A statue of a woman in the middle . This must be the God of Creation Malianor . On both sides of
                    Malianor-sama are five statues of men . On her right-hand side, there is the Fire God
                    Salamanteel-sama and the Earth God Nomoodle-sama . On her left-hand side, the Water God Windell-sama
                    and Wind God Sylphreel-sama――It’s Syl .
                </p>
                <p>「Will you wait here for a while?」</p>
                <p>I sit Allen and Elena on one of the stools, stand in front of the statue of Syl and look at it .</p>
                <p>Ah, it’s Syl .</p>
                <p>The stone statue has exactly the same appearances I remember .</p>
                <p>
                    People normally glorify and exaggerate the appearances of a god, but it seems that the actual
                    appearances of gods have been properly transmitted to the people of Aetherdia .
                </p>
                <p>（Syl~ Can you hear me?）</p>
                <hr />
                <p>I close my eyes and call Syl at once .</p>
                <p>(Takumi-san, I can hear you)</p>
                <p>Syl immediately answers back .</p>
                <p>It seems my voice reached him properly .</p>
                <p>(Did you get used to the life over there?)</p>
                <p>
                    (I have arrived at the town just today . So I don’t think I can say I got already used to it . But,
                    I didn’t have a hard time thanks to the magic and the convenient tools)
                </p>
                <p>(That is good)</p>
                <p>Syl was really concerned about me, it felt like that .</p>
                <p>Having people that are concerned about you is nice . It feels somewhat warming .</p>
                <p>――However! This and that are different things!</p>
                <p>(Right, Syl)</p>
                <p>(What is it?)</p>
                <p>(You didn’t tell me . Isn’t there something that you have to say to me?)</p>
                <p>I can imagine Syl’s body piki~in stiffen .</p>
                <p>(W, what are you saying, I, I don’t know~)</p>
                <p>…… No, you are definitely shaking .</p>
                <p>If you are going to pretend ignorance, I’m going to put on a little better performance .</p>
                <p>
                    (Hoho~u… I see… You don’t know? Then, it can’t be helped . They finally seem to taken liking to me,
                    but if Syl doesn’t know then I will have to put the poor children into an orphanage――)
                </p>
                <p>(Wa, waa~!! Wait~!!</p>
                <p>He gave up at once… I thought you were going to feign ignorance for a bit more, though~……</p>
                <p>(I’m so~rry)</p>
                <p>Ah, I don’t see him, but he’s definitely… prostrating……</p>
                <p>
                    (I thought it was strange . The starting location being A rank『Gaya Forest』, after all . No matter
                    how you look at it, you would normally start at such impossible place! But, I was able to leave the
                    forest before encountering a strong monster . Besides, it’s strange for children to be in such a
                    place! Moreover, they are “Human?” you know? At first I thought, there’s a race like that in this
                    world~ but, when I arrived at the town and appraised the people there, everyone was a normal human,
                    demihuman, and suchmon . I was fully suspecting you, Syl . So, what’s going on?)
                </p>
                <p>(Uu~)</p>
                <p>(Don’t cry and start explaining . It’s not like I will get angry or anything)</p>
                <p>Syl bursts into tears while prostrating .</p>
                <p>
                    Nono, you are a god, right? First… no, first is Malianor-sama so you are the second most important
                    person, right? Why are you so brittle?
                </p>
                <p>(Go on)</p>
                <p>(It can’t be said from my mouth……)</p>
                <p>(…………)</p>
                <p>When I urge the sobbing Syl to explain, he lets out some unexpected words .</p>
                <p>What? “Can’t say”…… moreover, Syl said, “from my”…</p>
                <p>N~…</p>
                <p>Is he forbidden to speak?</p>
                <p>From whom?</p>
                <p>No… if that’s the case, wouldn’t that be strange?</p>
                <p>If he imprudently spills it out, would he get in trouble…?</p>
                <p>An existence that can forbid Syl, a god from speaking, I can think only of those four .</p>
                <p>
                    (Say, Syl . Wind God, Fire God, Water God, Earth God, do you share nonaggression, territory or such
                    things…between each other?)
                </p>
                <p>(……… We do)</p>
                <p>I see . They do……</p>
                <p>That means, there’s another god who has a relation with Allen and Elena?</p>
                <p>I don’t think it’s Malianor-sama . Then, it’s someone between Fire, Water, and Earth…</p>
                <p>
                    (It’s just, those children are no ordinary children, leaving them would be dangerous…… I can tell
                    you only that)
                </p>
                <p>(I understand . I won’t ask anymore . Just… am I all right?)</p>
                <p>
                    (Takumi-san has become a part of my family, but it doesn’t change the fact that you will be living
                    on Aetherdia like a normal human so… There’s just no control restriction, so there’s no limit to
                    what you can do)
                </p>
                <p>(Is there no problem with you assisting me?)</p>
                <p>
                    (Yes . It doesn’t change that Takumi-san is my family and since you have received a blessing from
                    Malianor-sama it’s only natural to offer assistance)
                </p>
                <p>(So, in the end, we are using a loophole……)</p>
                <p>Allen and Elena are related to a god . Moreover, not just followers, something more important .</p>
                <p>It’s just my conjecture since I can’t get more details, though .</p>
                <p>…… At any rate――</p>
                <p>(……… Wasn’t my existence godsend?)</p>
                <p>(… You are angry…… right?)</p>
                <p>
                    (Speaking honestly, if only you told me right away instead of stealthily scheming…… is what I’m
                    thinking)
                </p>
                <p>(I’m really sorry……)</p>
                <p>(It’s okay already . It’s okay to rely on you when I encounter trouble, right?)</p>
                <p>(Yes! I don’t mind no matter how trivial it is . Please, contact me anytime!)</p>
                <p>(I understand . I will be relying on you at that time . Laters)</p>
                <p>The conversation with Syl was forcibly ended in the middle .</p>
                <p>
                    Syl himself is hopeless, I can understand his reasoning, but I was used, after all, I couldn’t erase
                    my negative emotions .
                </p>
                <p>However, I’m definitely not angry nor disappointed .</p>
                <p>
                    My new heart just probably didn’t settle properly yet . I think there won’t be any problems if I
                    give it a while . Once it’s settled, I will contact Syl again and make many demands . That will make
                    the offset .
                </p>
                <p>「Allen, Elena . Come here」</p>
                <p>Once my heart settled, I turn around and call the twins over .</p>
                <p>When I call them, the two immediately trot over to me, I crouch and hold them in my arms .</p>
                <p>「Thank you for waiting . Shall we return to the inn?」</p>
                <p>I walk back to the inn with two smiling children in my arms and setting sun in the back .</p>
            </div>
            <div id="chr-content" class="chr-c">
                <p>Chapter 8</p>
                <p>Good morning . Sleeping in the bed is indeed nice .</p>
                <hr />
                I have children on both of my sides so I can’t really move, though .
                <p>
                    Apart from that, listen to this! I didn’t notice because I didn’t have a mirror until now, but my
                    eyes are green! When I saw my reflection in one of the windows, I was really startled . It’s the
                    same jade green as Syl’s .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because nothing was said regarding my appearances and I didn’t request anything, so the appearances
                    were done without my consent . Black hair was a necessity…
                </p>
                <p>Maa, there are no problems if my eye color is different .</p>
                <p>Now then, after we slowly finished breakfast, we headed to the Adventurer’s Guild .</p>
                <p>It’s a building with a sign of a pentagon shield with two crossed swords .</p>
                <p>
                    When we enter inside, a spacious hall comes to sight . Because I came here today only to register,
                    we set off with the third chime, but there are adventurers still loitering around here and there .
                    Because these people are wearing armor and carrying weapons, there’s no doubt that they are
                    adventurers .
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are mostly concentrated around the bulletin board on the left side of the hall . That’s most
                    likely the place where requests are put .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maa~ but, there’s an available receptionist at the counter so I wasn’t wrong to come at this time .
                </p>
                <p>Without further ado, I take Allen and Elena and approach the receptionist .</p>
                <p>「Good morning . What may I help you with?」</p>
                <p>The female guild receptionist greets us with a sweet business smile .</p>
                <p>
                    「Adventurer registration, please . Ah, these children too . There’s no age restriction, is there?」
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I convey my business, the receptionist looks at Allen and Elena . A surprised look appears on
                    her face, but she immediately returns to her original expression .
                </p>
                <p>Small children like these rarely come here, right?</p>
                <p>
                    The age of majority in this world is 15, but it’s not unusual to start working earlier . Although I
                    say that, it’s just helping parents with work or routine tasks for the town . The Guild also has
                    requests related to routine tasks for the town . However, most of the children who work like that
                    are over 10 years old…
                </p>
                <p>
                    「Yes . There’s no age restriction so registration is possible . Please fill the necessary
                    information on this form . Do you require amanuensis1 ?」
                </p>
                <p>「No, it’s all right . Thank you very much」</p>
                <p>
                    I give my thanks, receive the form and pen and check the contents . The necessary items to fill are
                    the name, age, and special skill (Primary way of fighting) . It’s only these three items .
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have never seen the characters the form is written in before, but I properly understand them .
                    There are no problems with writing .
                </p>
                <p>After checking the form over, I fill out three papers .</p>
                <hr />
                For the special skills item, it’s magic (Wind) for me, and hand to hand combat for Allen and Elena .
                <p>I hand the forms to the receptionist after filling them out .</p>
                <p>「Yes, thank you very much . Please wait a moment until the card is completed」</p>
                <p>
                    When the receptionist miss received the forms, she checked whether there are some problems and then
                    she started operating a crystal .
                </p>
                <p>After several minutes, she lines up three credit card-like metal cards on the counter .</p>
                <p>
                    「Please check whether the name is correct then drip a drop of blood on the card . This will
                    complete the registration . After the registration is completed, please check for abnormalities」
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Guild Card is a magic tool . The 『ownership』of the card is determined by the blood and no one
                    aside from the owner won’t be able to use it .
                </p>
                <p>First, I drip blood on my card and register it .</p>

                <p>A good amount of information is written on the card .</p>
                <p>Ah, I’m glad . It says I’m an ordinary Human .</p>
                <p>
                    There are 5 “＊” main entries are obligatory to display, therefore, it, fortunately, doesn’t display
                    the family . I feel relieved because the other information is optional and can be hidden . With
                    this, only those with permission will be able to see my details .
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s a possibility that Guild staff would need to read it, but it should be all right if I just
                    conceal the necessary details .
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, Allen and Elena drip their blood on the cards and I don’t forget to alter their settings
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    「There’s a fee for reissue, so please be careful of losing it . Would you like to hear the
                    explanation about the guild?」
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s no fee to register as an adventurer, but it seems it costs 2,000G (2 Large Silver Coins) for
                    reissue the card if lost .
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have the knowledge about the rules of the guild, but because it would be troublesome if there is
                    some discrepancy, I request for the explanation . 『Well then』 Miss receptionist bowed and began
                    the explanation .
                </p>
                <p>First, the explanation about the ranks .</p>
                <p>The ranks begin at F, and raising to E, D, C, B, A and S .</p>
                <p>Rule of a thumb of the ranks――</p>
                <p>F Rank – Newcomer</p>
                <p>E Rank – Fledgling</p>
                <p>D Rank – Full-fledged</p>
                <p>C Rank – Skilled</p>
                <p>B Rank – Superior</p>
                <p>A Rank – Superior+α</p>
                <p>S Rank – Hero</p>
                <p>――Those are the standards .</p>
                <p>
                    In addition, there’s something called a party where several people handle a single request . In that
                    case, the Party Rank becomes the average rank of the party members .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Requests which are located on the Request Board (Request Subject, Reward, Time Period are
                    written on them) you bring them from the board to the reception and once accepted, you can begin the
                    request .
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s a recommended rank written on the Request and you are able to receive requests one rank
                    above yours . The reward is received after completion, there is no penalty fee for failure .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number of successful and failed requests is considered during a rank up . It’s harder to rank up
                    with too many failures and there even exists a penalty for consecutive failures .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if you don’t receive requests in three years, the registration will be revoked, and the
                    registration will be disposed of if you commit vicious acts .
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the exception of materials collected for the requests, it’s possible to sell monster materials,
                    ingredients, etc . at the Guild’s counter . There are fixed prices which profit the adventurers .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, adventurers are free to sell their materials to individual shops, but if problems arise,
                    the Adventurer’s Guild won’t get involved .
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the Guild functions as a bank and the money deposited at the Guild can be withdrawn at
                    any Guild branch in any country .
                </p>
                <p>
                    And last, the Guild does not involve in quarrels between fellow adventurers, injuries and in the
                    worst case death are all self-responsibility . This concludes the explanation .
                </p>
                <p>「This is all . Do you have any questions?」</p>
                <p>「Yes, the party registration, please」</p>
                <p>「I understand . Your guild cards, please」</p>
                <p>I register me, Allen and Elena as a party at once .</p>
                <hr />
                The party’s name is『White Wings』 . I imagined angels since the children are god’s relatives .
                <p>
                    I have money that I received from Syl, but it’s a finite amount, so I have to work for a steady
                    income .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The identification papers were the purpose, but in a different world, it has to be Adventurer,
                    right!
                </p>
                <p>Therefore, I simply registered as an adventurer .</p>
                <p>But, the problem is Allen and Elena .</p>
                <p>
                    It would be best if Allen and Ellen could do house-sitting when I’m on a request, but I think those
                    two would definitely follow me .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maa, the children are strong, they won’t become a burden . If that’s the case, it would be best to
                    prepare everything right from the start .
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be better than having them sneaking away during the house-sitting . Besides, I want those
                    two to see various things and places!
                </p>
                <p>「The registration is complete」</p>
                <p>「Thank you very much」</p>
                <p>「Will you receive a request today?」</p>
                <p>
                    「No…… ah! If I have medicinal herbs or monster materials at hand, will there be any problem using
                    them for a request?」
                </p>
                <p>
                    「No, if the condition of the material is good, there are no problems . Do you have anything with
                    you?」
                </p>
                <p>
                    「No, just making sure . Would it be alright to trouble you again if I have more questions later?」
                </p>
                <p>「Yes . I’m responsible for reception, my name is Luna . I look forward working with you」</p>
                <p>「Thank you very much . You probably already know, but I’m Takumi . Please treat me well」</p>
                <p>
                    I recalled the materials from the Gaya Forest, but as expected, a newcomer who just registered
                    bringing out such things would bring too much attention so I gave up .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, after giving my thanks to the polite receptionist miss――Luna-san, I take Allen and Elena and
                    leave the guild .
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, I went to return the temporary identification papers to the west gate and wandered
                    around the town aimlessly afterwards .

                <h3>CHAPTER 9 – THE FIRST JOB</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    When I wake up in the morning, Allen and Elena were already up . They are clinging on both of my
                    sides staring at my face fixedly .
                </p>
                <p>This has become a habit since our first camping in the forest .</p>
                <p>「…… Morning」</p>
                <p>「「……Mor… ning…」」</p>
                <p>「!!」</p>
                <p>They greeted me!! Allen and Elena spoke!</p>
                <p>What adorable voices!</p>
                <p>I who was greatly impressed hugged the two children reflectively .</p>
                <p>◇ ◇ ◇</p>
                <p>After having my fill of embracing the two, I finished preparations and we went to the guild .</p>
                <p>
                    It’s full of people, unlike yesterday . I go towards the low-rank Request Board while Allen and
                    Elena are tightly sticking to me in order to not get separated .
                </p>
                <p>A low-rank male and female adventurers around my age are gazing at the board .</p>
                <p>A great number of Requests are closely packed together on the board .</p>
                <p>There are three main types of Requests .</p>
                <p>Gathering Request――A gathering job of a specific herbs or monster material .</p>
                <p>
                    Subjugation Request――A job to defeat a designated monster . After defeating it, a part of its body
                    is necessary as a subjugation proof .
                </p>
                <hr />
                Escort Request――A job to escort a person/item from a town to a town or protect them in a specific
                location .
                <p>
                    There are little to nothing Escort Requests for low-rankers . So I will be choosing between
                    gathering and subjugation .
                </p>
                <p>
                    N~ what should I pick…… Would taking a gathering herbs request at first be better? With that, Allen
                    and Elena can go with me…
                </p>
                <p>Thinking that, I pick one of the Requests and stand in the queue at the counter .</p>
                <p>「The next person」</p>
                <p>「Thank you」</p>
                <p>My turn finally came .</p>
                <p>The receptionist behind the counter is the same that took care of us yesterday, Luna-san .</p>
                <p>「Ara, Takumi-san . Good morning . A Request?」</p>
                <p>「Good morning . This is the Request, please」</p>
                <p>「Excuse me…… A gathering of Lilie Grass, I see . Your Guild Card, please」</p>
                <p>I hand the Request I picked to Luna-san after light greetings .</p>
                <p>
                    Luna-san confirmed the contents of the Request, received my Guild Card and quickly operated the
                    crystal .
                </p>
                <p>
                    「10 Lilie Grasses is considered a batch so please be careful . The time limit is until three days
                    later」
                </p>
                <p>Luna-san explains the important points of the Request .</p>
                <p>「Thank you very much」</p>
                <p>While saying my thanks, I received back my Guild Card and we leave the Guild .</p>
                <p>We go towards the south gate at once .</p>
                <p>
                    There is a small forest in the south of Shirin . There are no monsters aside from E, F Rank slimes,
                    and wolves . It’s a relatively safe area so it’s just the right place for newcomers and unskilled
                    adventurers .
                </p>
                <p>「Allen, Elena . This is the Lilie Grass」</p>
                <p>
                    After getting to the forest, I immediately find the Lilie Grass and show it to children . It has a
                    dark green stalk with several jagged maple-like leaves .
                </p>
                <p>The Lilie roots aren’t necessary so I cut the stalk and pick it up without the roots .</p>
                <p>「If you find it, gather it like this . Understood?」</p>
                <p>After Allen and Elena nod, they start searching the area for Lilie Grass at once .</p>
                <p>They found it immediately . They timidly hold it in their tiny hands and trot over to me .</p>
                <p>They uneasily look at me while holding out the Lilie Grass to me .</p>
                <p>「It’s all right, this is the one . You did great~」</p>
                <p>I pat the two children’s heads and receive the Lilie Grass while praising them .</p>
                <p>Happy for being praised, kya, kya they make a merry and run off looking for another Lilie Grass .</p>
                <p>I’m glad . It seems that their emotions and voices are returning little by little .</p>
                <p>I feel relieved that they are growing in the right direction .</p>
                <p>Now then, I should also start looking around~</p>
                <p>I found the plant right after I began the search .</p>
                <p>
                    Oh, Cren Grass and Maryoku Grass are also there . There was a request for that too if I’m not
                    mistaken . Let’s gather that too . Even if the Request won’t be there anymore, I can just store it
                    in the《Infinite Storage》for the time being .
                </p>
                <hr />
                Thinking that, I gather one plant after another .
                <p>
                    Along the way, Allen and Elena learned the characteristics of the various plants I was picking and
                    also started looking for them .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our gathering in the forest continues until the noon and the prepared jute bag was full of gathered
                    herbs .
                </p>
                <p>We gathered a sufficient amount .</p>
                <p>「Allen, Elena . Let’s stop for today」</p>
                <p>When I call the two, they trot over to me with hands full of herbs .</p>
                <p>「You both gathered so much~ Amazing~」</p>
                <p>When I praise them after receiving the plants, the two children make joyful expressions .</p>
                <p>So cute~ The two laughed a lot today .</p>
                <p>「Yosh, let’s return to town after eating a meal」</p>
                <p>
                    We left the forest, sat in the middle of a meadow with a great scenery, and returned to the town
                    after eating the food I bought at the stall in the town .
                </p>
                <p>◇ ◇ ◇</p>
                <p>
                    When we return to the Guild, I go straight to the Request Board and look for Requests with other
                    herbs .
                </p>
                <p>Umm… Cren Grass, Maryoku Grass, oh, Fenze Grass is also there .</p>
                <hr />
                I pick the Requests after comparing the gathered plants with the Requests . I have many plants that are
                insufficient numbers so I decide to store them in《Infinite Storage》and go to the counter .
                <p>「Welcome back」</p>
                <p>The one who greeted me at the counter was Luna-san again .</p>
                <p>「We have returned . These Requests in addition to the Request we have received this morning」</p>
                <p>「I will confirm . Put the materials in this basket please」</p>
                <p>
                    After exchanging greetings, I put the Guild Card together with the new Requests on the counter .
                    Luna-san received them and took out a basket .
                </p>
                <p>
                    I place the herbs into that basket . Because all kinds of herbs were in the 10 Requests I picked, I
                    line them up while counting .
                </p>
                <p>「… Y, you have quite a lot . It’s quite difficult to gather this much in half a day…」</p>
                <p>「It’s because the children did their best」</p>
                <p>The herbs turned into a heap because the basket is unexpectedly small .</p>
                <p>
                    Luna-san was a slightly surprised at the amount of herbs I took out, but she promptly started
                    checking the herbs .
                </p>
                <p>「This is this time’s reward」</p>
                <p>
                    Once the confirmation of the herbs is done, the reward money is presented . I confirm the amount of
                    money at the counter and put them into a bag .
                </p>
                <p>And when I think of returning――</p>
                <p>「Why are brats in here!」</p>
                <p>A large, bald adventurer comes over while shouting .</p>
            </div>
            <div id="chr-content" class="chr-c">
                <p>Chapter 10</p>
                <p>「Why are brats in here!」</p>
                <hr />
                <p>A loud voice echoes around the Guild .</p>
                <p>That voice gathers the attention of the other people around .</p>
                <p>「They are my company, is there a problem?」</p>
                <p>「This is not a place for brats to play!」</p>
                <p>「No… they are obediently behaving, right? I don’t think they are being a nuisance to you, but?」</p>
                <p>「There are nuisance just by being here!」</p>
                <p>「Just by being here, you say…… give me a break…」</p>
                <p>
                    This is the type of person who would pick up a fight no matter what I say . I’m certain my words
                    won’t connect with him .
                </p>
                <p>I would like to settle this peacefully, but…… now then, how to deal with this……</p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to sigh, but I forcibly suppressed it . The opponent seems to be the type that would get
                    even more agitated by it .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nevertheless, to think that there would actually be person who would pick a quarrel for no reason……
                    I thought this would happen only in novels .
                </p>
                <p>「Oi! Don’t ignore me!」</p>
                <p>「No, I told you…」</p>
                <p>「Aan!? Are you defying me right now?」</p>
                <p>The opponent suddenly extends his hand in order to grab me by the collar without a thought .</p>
                <p>Ah, it’s no use no matter what I say . Talking is impossible .</p>
                <p>Now then…… what to do……</p>
                <p>While thinking so, the hand that was grabbing to seize me was suddenly repelled .</p>
                <p>「Ah…」</p>
                <p>When I let the voice, it was already too late .</p>
                <p>
                    Allen and Elena kicked the bald adventurer’s hand away . Then, they proceed to kick him in the
                    abdomen just like that .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The adventurer let’s out『Gu!』a suffering groan while his upper body bent . He then fell back right
                    on his backside .
                </p>
                <p>「Uwa! Stop, stop! Allen, Elena . Wait!」</p>
                <p>I shout in panic .</p>

                I stop Allen and Elena a second before they can both land ax kick on the collapsed adventurer’s head .
                <p>The kicks that were going to land directly on his head just barely swept beside him .</p>
                <p>That was dangerous… seriously dangerous…</p>
                <p>He would definitely die if those ax kicks landed .</p>
                <p>
                    His upper body fall down with a thud and he stopped moving . He must have already fainted after
                    suffering the hit to his abdomen .
                </p>
                <p>A silence drifts in the Guild which was noisy just a minute ago .</p>
                <p>The adventurers and the Guild staff stiffened in shock .</p>
                <p>
                    Even if they are used to fighting, witnessing small children KO’ing a grown man must have been
                    really surprising .
                </p>
                <p>Well then…… what do I do now?</p>
                <p>「Ou . Excuse me……… N? What?」</p>
                <p>A person walks into the guild and looks around the frozen stiff guild dumbfoundedly .</p>
                <p>「What, what? Did something happen?」</p>
                <p>A familiar voice . If I’m not mistaken, it should be one of the west gate Knight-samas .</p>
                <p>He is not wearing armor today, but a dark blue knight uniform .</p>
                <p>Thanks to him, the stopped time in the Guild started moving again .</p>
                <p>First of all, I turn to the Guild staff behind the counter and timidly ask .</p>
                <p>「Ah~…… Is there a punishment in a case like this?」</p>
                <p>I can’t leave without asking that, right?</p>
                <p>◇ ◇ ◇</p>
                <p>There was no punishment .</p>
                <p>
                    This time, we were not at fault because the other party one-sidedly picked a quarrel with us and we
                    only defended ourselves .
                </p>
                <p>I’m glad…</p>
                <hr />
                The fallen adventurer was dragged to the guild’s sick bay by other adventures on the guild staff
                instructions, he started moving again normally after a while .
                <p>「This~ Takumi-san…」</p>
                <p>「Yes?」</p>
                <p>「See…… the children……」</p>
                <p>「He?」</p>
                <p>
                    Luna-san reservedly calls out to me . Prompted by those words, I turn around to look at Allen and
                    Ellen…… they were crying .
                </p>
                <p>There were shedding tears without a voice .</p>
                <p>「Waa!? Why are you crying!?」</p>
                <p>I rush up to the two children in panic and crouch to match their line of sight .</p>
                <p>「Injuries… none, right? What’s wrong?」</p>
                <p>「…… Don’t… leave us……」</p>
                <p>They cling to me with a fragile voice .</p>
                <p>Leave? Why?</p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps, is it because I raised my voice a little while ago? Are those two uneasy because of that?
                </p>
                <p>They thought I was angry at them…</p>
                <p>「I won’t leave you . It’s all right, okay?」</p>
                <p>
                    I embrace the crying children while repeating『It’s all right』『We are together』 in a gentle voice
                    .
                </p>
                <p>It took about ten minutes for those two to calm down .</p>
                <p>「Here, you must be thirsty, right?」</p>
                <p>Still sobbing a little, I hand the two a fruit juice .</p>
                <p>They cried a lot, I must let them rehydrate properly .</p>
                <p>「In the end, what has happened?」</p>
                <p>Ah, Knight-sama, you are still here…</p>
                <hr />
                The Knight-sama from the west gate is the second commanding officer of Shirin Knight’s, a noble named
                Grunwald Ruven .
                <p>
                    A captain of one of five Shirin’s divisions . The second most important person in the Shirin Knights
                    . It seems he came today to talk to the Guild Master .

                <p>Un, he has the skills appropriate of a noble knight-sama .</p>
                <p>
                    Indeed, a knight should be about riding a horse and swinging weapons around . Besides,【Commanding】
                    . Un, I feel like it’s necessary for a captain .
                </p>
                <p>【Etiquette】and【Dancing】is noble-ish .</p>
                <p>
                    The title【Knight of the Flaming Sword】sounds cool~ Looking at the name, is it about using a sword
                    enhanced with Fire Magic?
                </p>
                <p>…… Oops, he asked a question .</p>
                <p>「They probably thought I would abandon them」</p>
                <p>「Haa? What’s that about? You, would you do such a thing?」</p>
                <p>「I won’t do anything like that! Please don’t such something so disgraceful」</p>
                <p>「Then, why are they thinking so?」</p>
                <p>「No~ I didn’t perfectly grasp the understanding yet, I still don’t understand well~」</p>
                <p>That’s the truth . I don’t know their circumstances before meeting me at that place .</p>
                <p>「They are your children…… probably not, they are your sibling, aren’t they?」</p>
                <p>
                    「Unfortunately, they are not . I have just met these children recently . To be precise, a week ago?
                    They were in the Gaya Forest」
                </p>
                <p>「Haa?」</p>
                <p>「If they were discarded or just lost, I do not know, though」</p>
                <p>「Seriously?」</p>
                <p>
                    「Yeah . Wasn’t there recently a carriage attacked near the Gaya Forest or something? They were most
                    likely slaves」
                </p>
                <p>
                    Weren’t they sold as slaves because they don’t have parents? Is what I think . After all, if they
                    were in the orphanage, I wouldn’t meet them in a place like that .
                </p>
                <p>
                    「…… There certainly was . A Slave Trader from the Argo was attacked by monsters in the Gaya Forest
                    while heading to this town」
                </p>
                <p>Luna-san immediately recalls the information .</p>
                <p>「Ah, as expected . They were probably made into a decoy」</p>
                <p>「Children like these…」</p>
                <p>
                    「It doesn’t look like they were the ones to become the decoy in the end, though . In this case, how
                    are these children going to be treated? There won’t be problems if I take them in, right?
                    Fortunately, they don’t have any proof of being slaves」
                </p>
                <p>
                    「In that case, they are simply treated as orphans . There won’t be problems to put them into
                    orphanage or raise them yourself . 。Besides, it looks like these children completely recognize you
                    as their guardian . If you’d like, I will guarantee you」
                </p>
                <p>「Ruven-sama, thank you very much」</p>
                <p>
                    I was worried about the interference from the merchant, but it doesn’t seem like there will be
                    problems .
                </p>
                <p>It seems like Ruven-sama will become the guarantee .</p>
                <p>「Wald is all right . Apart from that――」</p>
                <p>「Rather than that, Takumi-san! You went into the Gaya Forest!」</p>
                <p>
                    Luna-san interrupts Ruven-sama who said it’s okay to call him Wald-sama, and she bends forward over
                    the counter .

                <p>「Rather than that, Takumi-san! You went into the Gaya Forest?」</p>
                <hr />
                「Eh?」
                <p>「What’s going on!!」</p>
                <p>「… Yes . There were medicinal plants I needed」</p>
                <p>What an amazingly angry look……</p>
                <p>Gaya Forest…… was there such settings?</p>
                <p>
                    「Is the reason you asked about the materials at hand when you came first to the Guild possibly…」
                </p>
                <p>Ah, she noticed . Luna-san, you remember it…</p>
                <p>「Do you have them?」</p>
                <p>「………」</p>
                <p>What to do?</p>
                <p>Luna-san is staring at me with a great vigor . No…… no those are eyes looking at a prey……</p>
                <p>「You have them, right? …… Right?」</p>
                <p>「…… Yes」</p>
                <p>Chills ran through my back for some reason .</p>
                <p>In the end, I was completely defeated by Luna-san’s insight .</p>
                <p>Therefore, I decided to sell the materials I obtained in Gaya Forest .</p>
                <hr />
                As expected, because a number of days passed since then, I keep silent about the materials in
                the《Infinite Storage》and decided to sell only the one processed Red Wolf’s magic stone, fur, claws,
                fangs, and medicinal plants and fruits .
                <p>There wasn’t much, but Guild staff including Luna-san were overjoyed .</p>
                <p>
                    There are many calm zones in the outskirts of Shirin except Gaya Forest . The security is tight, the
                    flow of people is high because the town is near the borders, but there doesn’t seem to be many
                    veteran adventurers .
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are only a few adventurers who recently went to Gaya Forest so the stock of advanced materials
                    significally decreased, Luna-san earnestly explained .
                </p>
                <p>「Which reminds me, Wald-sama . Didn’t you come to talk with Guild Master?」</p>
                <p>
                    「Yeah, regarding an expedition . We periodically go to the Gaya Forest to thin out the monsters .
                    If left alone, the monsters would start pouring out which would be really troubling」
                </p>
                <p>「Is it a joint expedition of knights and high ranked adventures?」</p>
                <p>
                    「Yeah . The number of people I can take is limited because I can’t take everyone along . If I don’t
                    go into the depths, I won’t have enough people」
                </p>
                <p>「It’s an A Rank forest, after all~」</p>
                <p>「Because of that, Takumi . You are participating」</p>
                <p>Haa? What are you talking about?</p>
                <p>「Nono, I’m an F Rank, you know!?」</p>
                <p>「If you are able to go alone and defeat a Red Wolf there are no problems, right?」</p>
                <p>「………」</p>
                <p>Crap, I made a mistake . I shouldn’t take out the Red Wolf materials!</p>
                <p>
                    「Oh, it looks that Guild Master is free now . I will make an official request later, don’t run
                    away」
                </p>
                <p>「Wa, wait!」</p>
                <p>Saying just that, Wald-sama walks into the Guild Master’s office .</p>
                <p>「……… I can reject a designated request, right?」</p>
                <p>I ask Luna-san after a while of silence .</p>
                <p>
                    「It’s not impossible . But, when it comes to official request from the Knights, it becomes a
                    request of the country so……」
                </p>
                <p>Why did your voice become cloudy at the end!? Please confirm that I can decline!</p>
                <p>Why did it become like this? Where did I make a mistake?</p>
                <p>Where? I did take out the Red Wolf materials, right……</p>
                <p>Uwaa, it’s my fault! Aah, mou…</p>
                <p>「Anyway, I’m going home for today……」</p>
                <p>「Yes, thank you for your hard work」</p>
                <p>「Allen, Elena . We are leaving~」</p>
                <p>I lift the two who are still uneasy and leave towards the inn .</p>
                <p>◆ ◆ ◆</p>
                <p>――Inside the Guild Master’s office .</p>
                <p>「Ruven-dono, sorry for the wait」</p>
                <p>
                    The one greeting is a grizzled elderly man . This man is precisely the Guild Master of Gadia’s
                    Shirin Adventurer’s Guild branch .
                </p>
                <p>「No problem . It’s I who should apologize for coming during busy times」</p>
                <p>
                    Grunwald sits on a sofa, facing the Guild Master . A female staff member puts a cup of tea in front
                    of them, she then bows and quietly leaves the room .
                </p>
                <p>「Nono . Are you here today regarding the subjugation expedition to Gaya Forest?」</p>
                <p>
                    「That’s right . As usually, I will leave the arrangements of adventures to you . The time planned
                    is at the beginning of the Fourth Month for one week」
                </p>
                <p>「I understand . I will prepare the request immediately」</p>
                <p>「Ah, in addition, please include a nomination for a person named Takumi Kayano this time」</p>
                <p>「Takumi Kayano… is it? I’m not familiar with that name, but…」</p>
                <p>
                    The business advanced smoothly as usually . But, Grunwald had one more request that is different
                    from the usual .
                </p>
                <p>Grunwald smiled at the Guild Master with a mysterious grin .</p>
                <p>
                    「He’s an F Rank newcomer who has registered to the Guild just recently . It’s only natural that
                    Guild Master doesn’t know of him」
                </p>
                <p>「You want to include a new adventurer to the expedition to Gaya Forest?」</p>
                <p>「Although a newcomer, he’s no amateur」</p>
                <p>
                    Grunwald recalls the moment Takumi came to the town for the first time and the another meeting from
                    today .
                </p>
                <hr />
                He’s an ordinary youth at glance . But, he perceived an extraordinary presence from that youth . It was
                only his intuition as an experienced fighter, though .
                <p>「He caught your eyes, is what you are saying?」</p>
                <p>「I’m interested a bit . Therefore, three parties as usual plus one, please」</p>
                <p>Besides, the children that are with the youth . They are no ordinary children .</p>
                <p>
                    Although he didn’t see it directly, according to the people who saw, those children destroyed a
                    giant man in an instant .
                </p>
                <p>That was enough for Grunwald to show interest .</p>
                <p>Incorporating them into a party made of A Rank and B Rank adventurers…</p>
                <p>
                    The subjugation expedition in Gaya Forest that Grunwald always considered troublesome . He can’t
                    help it, but to look forward to the due date this time . That is the face Grunwald is making .

                <p>◆ ◆ ◆</p>
                <p>Later, an official request from the Knights arrived .</p>
                <p>The designated request with all the details was handed to me by Luna-san .</p>
                <p>Nono, please don’t look at me with that smile!</p>
                <p>
                    I will decline…… eh? To decline, I have to go directly to the Knights? No way… that’s impossible…… I
                    understand . I will start preparing…
                </p>
                <p>Eh? Please bring a lot of advanced materials, you say…… Luna-san……</p>

                <p>＝＝＝＝＝</p>
                <p>
                    We defeat monsters on the side while doing Gathering Requests, my level slightly rose, my skills and
                    skill proficiencies increased slightly .
                </p>
                <p>I even obtained a【Savior】title .</p>
                <p>Did I receive it only by being together with Allen and Elena?</p>
                <p>
                    I don’t know what the standards are, but obtaining titles is not as surprising as meeting with a
                    god, therefore I decided to leave it be for the time being .
                </p>
                <p>◇ ◇ ◇</p>
                <p>「Takumi-san, are you not going to a dungeon?」</p>
                <p>We came to the guild right in the morning today .</p>
                <p>Luna-san inquiries while I view the Request Board while looking for a good Request .</p>
                <p>「Dungeon…… ah!!」</p>
                <p>
                    Dungeons are all over Aetherdia . I don’t know to what extent the people of this world know about
                    dungeons, but there exist 108 dungeons in total .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dungeons difficulty is determined by the number and variety of the monsters inside, the floors are
                    divided into a bottom, middle and high levels .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although people are aware of dungeon’s existence, there are still many undiscovered dungeons . As
                    for how the dungeon’s difficulty is determined……
                </p>
                <p>It’s determined by the existence and efficiency of dungeon’s transfer devices .</p>
                <p>Beginner Class――No transfer device .</p>
                <p>Intermediate Class――Transfer devices are installed every ten floors .</p>
                <p>Advanced Class――Transfer device on each floor .</p>
                <p>Such easy to understand criteria are in effect .</p>
                <p>
                    Because it seems that capturing a single floor of Advanced dungeon takes up to several days, it
                    wouldn’t be possible to easily capture the dungeon without transfer devices .
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, it’s unknown how the dungeons work, but the monster defeated in them don’t leave
                    corpses behind . Instead, defeated monsters leave behind a part of materials――they are leaving
                    behind a Drop Item .
                </p>
                <p>You never know what Drop Item will be left behind .</p>
                <p>
                    If you defeat Red Wolf, it’s materials, claws, fangs or meat… you have no choice but to defeat many
                    to get what you need .
                </p>
                <p>Also, it’s possible that a rare item would drop . Some amazing medicine can be obtained .</p>
                <p>Maa~ it happens only rarely .</p>
                <p>There is a 15-floors deep Low dungeon near Shirin .</p>
                <p>
                    「I totally forgot their existence . No wonder we rarely bump into other adventurers outside the
                    twon」
                </p>
                <p>
                    「Is that so? I was certain you didn’t want to go because of the children . You are very helpful
                    because you are taking on Requests on non-dungeon materials, though」
                </p>
                <p>「You mean that most of the adventurers are going to the dungeon?」</p>
                <p>
                    「Yes . Most of the adventurers, up to D-Rank go to the nearby dungeon . The adventurers above
                    D-Rank mostly take on Escort Requests . Truthfully, only a few newcomers go to the outskirts of the
                    town」
                </p>
                <p>
                    The monsters near the town aren’t a big deal . You must make a few days trip to arrive at a place
                    with strong monsters .
                </p>
                <p>「The dungeon is a half day on foot from here, after all」</p>
                <p>Half a day, huh… it’s surprisingly close .</p>
                <p>Going to the dungeon certainly enables making more money than going to the outskirts .</p>
                <p>「Then, should we also go to take a look~」</p>
                <p>「Eh!? You are going?」</p>
                <p>Luna-san gets surprised at my muttering .</p>
                <p>「We can’t?」</p>
                <p>
                    「Nono, that’s not it . It’s just the designated Request for Gaya Forest is next week, so I was
                    thinking if it’s not too hard timewise……」
                </p>
                <p>
                    「Ah . You could say I intended only to take a look at the bottom floors before challenging, so we
                    should have plenty of time, right? If I deduct a day off before the designated Request and the
                    travel time, we should be diving just for three days」
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the traveling may increase with Allen and Elena traveling with me, we will be able to dive
                    at least for three days .
                </p>
                <p>It’s plenty of time for sightseeing, right?</p>
                <p>
                    「I think so . Fufu . When it comes to Takumi-san and the children I was under the selfish
                    impression that you would “capture” it straight away」
                </p>
                <p>「You are expecting too much from E-Rank adventueres」</p>
                <p>「Ara, not at all . It’s not just me, it’s the evaluation of the entire Guild, you know?」</p>
                <p>
                    I have a feeling that the Guild’s expectations got heavy since the incident on the day of our first
                    Request .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though I was just a human that didn’t stand out at all on Earth, I have a feeling that it’s the
                    exact opposite on Aetherida .
                </p>
                <p>I stopped being normal the moment I became a god’s family, though……</p>
                <p>I just can’t get used to it .</p>
                <p>I left the guild with such complicated thoughts and purchased the necessities (mainly food) .</p>
                <p>
                    After that, I informed the『Komadori Pavilion』couple that we will be going out for a few days and
                    headed towards the dungeon .
                </p>
                <p>◇ ◇ ◇</p>
                <p>There was still some time until sunset when we arrived at the dungeon .</p>
                <p>The plan was to arrive in the evening, stay overnight and go to the dungeon the next day .</p>
                <p>
                    This happened because Allen and Elena walked better than I expected . Their pace was fast with small
                    steps .
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s no need to hurry that much, I told them, but the two didn’t lower their pace . In addition,
                    their stamina is better than that of an ordinary adult so we have arrived earlier .
                </p>
                <p>Now then, what should we do?</p>
                <p>The fourth dungeon “The Dungeon of Earth” .</p>
                <p>
                    A 15-floor underground dungeon with an earth attribute . A dungeon with relatively high capture rate
                    .
                </p>
                <p>The entrance to the dungeon is hollowed in a two-story large rock .</p>
                <p>
                    From there, a sloping road spreads out . It’s wide enough to fit three adult men . The depths are
                    not fully visible .
                </p>
                <p>Spend a night here as planned or to enter the dungeon nearly……</p>
                <p>「In」</p>
                <p>「Go~」</p>
                <p>While considering what to do, Allen and Elena exclaim .</p>
                <p>「Is it really okay? Are you not tired?」</p>
                <p>「「Is al~right」」</p>
                <p>
                    Since the two say they are okay, I decided to go inside . I will only watch their condition properly
                    and take a break before they get fatigued .
                </p>
                <p>
                    I illuminate the surroundings with《Light》before descending . I can keep on the《Light》for one
                    hour before having to cast it again . As it can only illuminate the surroundings in 1m radius, I
                    locked hands with Allan and Elena and started walking .
                </p>
                <p>「Looks like a normal tunnel, huh」</p>
                <p>There is a hall further down . A hall that looks like a tunnel in a large mine .</p>
                <p>
                    The walls and floor are made from earth, but it seems to be very sturdy as it’s not easily damaged .
                    In addition, it’s wide enough to swing a sword in all directions . The route in the distance seems
                    to be complicated as a maze, though .
                </p>
                <p>The first straight path comes to an end quickly . It splits into two passages .</p>
                <p>Allen and Elena restlessly look at the passages .</p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of mazes, walking along one side of the wall will bring us to an exit (the previous path in
                    this situation) without problems… what to do?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Guild is selling the dungeon map, but it’s only accurate up to the fifth floor so I didn’t
                    purchase it .
                </p>
                <p>Ah, which reminds me, wasn’t there a map function in the menu?</p>
                <p>I open the window screen at once .</p>
                <p>
                    N~ there’s no map while inside a dungeon . There’s auto mapping function instead . It displays only
                    the way we went .
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, with this, we won’t lose our way no matter which road we go and we will be able to easily
                    return back .
                </p>
                <p>If that’s the case… let’s let the children choose the way .</p>
                <p>「Allen, Elena . Which way do you want to go?」</p>
                <p>「「? …… That way~」」</p>
                <p>They point in the same direction at the same time .</p>
                <p>Then, let’s go that way first!</p>

            <div id="chr-content" class="chr-c">
                <p>Chapter 13</p>
                <h3>CHAPTER 13 – DUNGEON OF EARTH・CAPTURE 1</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>Proceeding in the directions Allen and Elena have picked, we quickly found stairs leading below .</p>
                <p>Looking at the map, this is possibly the shortest way .</p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the two children’s opinion which way to take didn’t differ even once . They are
                    demonstrating the twin power to its fullest .
                </p>
                <p>Beshi .</p>
                <p>Dokan .</p>
                <p>Zuruzuru…</p>
                <p>Batain .</p>
                <p>Allen’s and Elena’s exploding kicks .</p>
                <p>It gets blown off and crashes into the wall .</p>
                <p>It slides to the ground just like that .</p>
                <p>It ceased to breathe .</p>
                <p>How many times did I see the exact same scene…</p>
                <p>Un . There’s no enemy! Hahaha .</p>
                <p>
                    Because the monsters in the Low Class dungeon aren’t that strong, I let Allen and Elena deal with
                    them as they see fit .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thereupon, all Slimes, Ground Moles, Ground Spiders (Indeed, this being “Dungeon of Earth” the
                    monsters that appear are mainly that of earth attribute) who appeared …… were defeated one by one .
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, I let the kids run wild, but such training in the future, would it still be okay? Being
                    strong is not a bad thing . Especially in this world where the average lifespan is shorter than on
                    Earth .
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are still small, so it’s okay, right? In Japan, they would be in pre-schoolers . Pre-schoolers
                    should be playing vigorously, right?

                Once they grow up a little more, I will start teaching them, or let them attend school! Everything would
                be all right then!
                <p>
                    We have arrived at the 5th floor without an accident; there is a small room, so I decided to call it
                    a day and camp there .
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, I clean their bodies with《Washing》 . They are not that dirty, but keeping hygiene is good .
                </p>
                <p>Next is the dinner preparation .</p>
                <p>
                    I take out portable stove magic tool . Maa~ it’s similar to a tabletop electric cooking device .
                    Although it’s not running on electricity, but on fire magic stones . I have found this magic tool
                    while walking around the town . This was the only magic tool for a reasonable price . But, even if
                    the price weren’t reasonable, I would buy it on the spot because of the convenience .
                </p>
                <p>I put a pot with soup on top of the magic tool and warm it up .</p>
                <p>
                    I asked the『Komadori Pavilion』boss if he could cook something for me and this is it . It’s soup
                    with a tomato base, lots of meat and various vegetables .
                </p>
                <p>The sweetness and acidity are refreshing .</p>
                <p>
                    Then, I made a potato salad with a fresh bread I bought back in the town . Unfortunately, they
                    didn’t have a square bread, therefore I had to use a round one .
                </p>
                <p>Un, seems good! Well then, itadakimasu .</p>
                <p>After eating the dinner, it’s preparations to sleep .</p>
                <p>
                    That being said, my sleeping posture is leaning on the wall while sitting wrapped in a blanket with
                    two children clinging to my sides . The same as in Gaya Forest .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Normally, it would be necessary to set up a barrier with Barrier Stones . It’s a defensive measure
                    against both monsters and humans . Bandits for example . Also, I’m afraid to say that nasty
                    adventurers also exist . They would attack an unwatched place and steal all your belongings .
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, I’m the only one of us who can stand a watch . I have a feeling that my body would be able to
                    go on without sleep for a few days, but I have no intention of trying it out .
                </p>
                <p>It’s all right . We will definitely wake up when a person with ill intent approaches us .</p>
                <p>That being said, good night .</p>
                <p>The next day, the second day .</p>
                <p>
                    When I wake up my eyes, Allen and Elena were already up and staring fixedly at my face while
                    clinging to my arms as usual .
                </p>
                <p>I fix my clothes and prepare a simple breakfast .</p>
                <p>The menu is sausage and scrambled eggs, fresh bread with strawberry jam .</p>
                <p>
                    The sausage and eggs are quickly cooked . The strawberry jam is something Syl prepared for me, made
                    in Japan .
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s a proper product information-like paper on the jar, but its contents are written with
                    Aetherdia’s letters . And, there is <strong>MADE IN JAPAN</strong> written on it .
                </p>
                <p>Did Syl intentionally replace it? To be sensible to such degree……</p>
                <p>Maa, we three gratefully consumed it .</p>
                <p>We took a little break after the breakfast and commenced the capturing of the 5th floor .</p>
                <p>We advanced smoothly just like on the first four floors without change .</p>
                <p>The Dropped Items weren’t too expensive, but the amount is significant .</p>
                <p>
                    There’s no problem if you have a Magic Bag, but there are probably many low ranked adventurers who
                    still don’t have it . If that’s the case, they would probably start sorting out their stuff and
                    dispose of the rest . They probably think it’s all right to dispose of it since the market price is
                    low~ Particularly, this “Slime Jelly” which doesn’t look like it has a use…
                </p>
                <p>What is this used for? It’s squishy and cool, it’s pleasing to touch .</p>
                <p>
                    Can this be used for mattress or cushion? Doesn’t it sound lovely? Yosh, let’s try making it if I
                    find time .
                </p>
                <p>
                    First of all,《Infinite Storage》may fertilize it, but I don’t know its use so I will put it
                    together with everything else .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of baggage, Allen and Elena are fundamentally empty-handed . I want to keep the things they
                    have at them at minimum if they separate from me by any chance~ I don’t have plans to get separated,
                    and there is no problem to start looking for them if they do immediately, but things like money…
                    water, and preserved food . And a knife would also be good to have~
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, all that packed in a bag would get in the way during a close combat… Besides, it would be
                    heavy~
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should I get some low-class Magic Bags for the kids? But, isn’t it dangerous for children to carry
                    expensive magic tools around?
                </p>
                <p>Yosh! Let’s ponder about this matter a bit more!</p>
                <p>Beshi .</p>
                <p>Dokan .</p>
                <p>Zuruzuru…</p>
                <p>Batain .</p>
                <p>Ah, a wolf flew again .</p>
                <p>The enemies are still lacking . We keep on advancing at steady pace .</p>
                <p>◇ ◇ ◇</p>
                <p>
                    The capturing proceeds and we are currently on the 8th floor . We have captured half of the dungeon
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The quality of the monsters increased a little . An insect monster with a hard shell that Allen and
                    Elena can’t defeat in one hit has started appearing .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The kids have a bad affinity with insect monsters, unlike the usual animal type . Although they
                    won’t get defeated, they will hurt their bodies by hitting that hard shell over and over again, so I
                    decided to take care of the insects myself .
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the monsters have stopped appearing alone and started attacking in groups . From small
                    groups of 2~3 up to a big group of around 10 .
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don’t have any problems, but the first obstacle for the young adventurers is most likely this 8th
                    floor .
                </p>
                <p>While advancing――</p>
                <p>「Uwa――――!!」</p>
                <p>A cry echoes from ahead .</p>
                <p>「Please run a~way!!」</p>
                <p>
                    The desperate cry was from a party of adventurers . A party of young men and women in their teens .
                </p>
                <p>
                    A group of monsters is chasing the party . Wolves, Horn Rabbits and Slicer Bats, tens of various
                    monsters in a group .
                </p>
                <p>「Wa, hey! What are you doing!?」</p>
                <p>A young adventurer stops right after passing us and shouts at us in panic .</p>
                <p>
                    “I want to escape quickly” and “We should have left it alone” emotions were transmitted to me from
                    his expression .
                </p>
                <p>「《Wind Cutter》」</p>
                <p>
                    When all people in my field of vision disappear, and all in front of me are monsters, I cast wind
                    magic while emphasizing the magic power behind it .
                </p>
                <p>Several wind blades pour on the monsters who changed the target on us .</p>
                <p>Un, most of them got defeated .</p>
                <p>
                    However, a monster slips from within the cloud of dust . But, at that moment, Allen and Elena charge
                    towards the monster and drive a kick into its body without reserve .
                </p>
                <p>「Eeeeeeeeh―――!!」</p>
                <p>The young adventurers who witnessed that shout in disbelief .</p>
